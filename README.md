Employee Promotion (HR-Analytics)
Introduction
HR analytics is revolutionising the way human resources departments operate, leading to higher efficiency and better results overall. Human resources has been using analytics for years. However, the collection, processing and analysis of data has been largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the approach has been constraining HR. There is an opportunity to try predictive analytics in identifying the employees most likely to get promoted.

Hence, company needs help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular time point and making the promotion process smoother for the organisation
